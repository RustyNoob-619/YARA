# Collection of my YARA rules

## Please see the below:

=> Watch out for YARA rule files starting with the VT namiing convention as these will not work outside Virus Total

=> These rules are written from Threat Research perspective and hence performance considerations are not taken into account

=> Watch out for the YARA rules starting with the TTP naming convention as these are generic in nature and do not on their own mean malicious but should rather me used in combination with other rules
